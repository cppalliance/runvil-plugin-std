//! `build-checks` - this repository's structural checks. Each check
//! returns a list of violations a person can read, and a test asserts the
//! list is empty, so `cargo test -p build-checks` enforces the rules in
//! `AGENTS.md` that the compiler and clippy cannot.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - A check reads source files and never builds or runs the code it
//!   checks.
//! - A file a check cannot read or parse is a violation, never a file to
//!   skip.
